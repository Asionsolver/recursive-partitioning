# Dynamic Partition Splitting Application

This project is an interactive color-splitting app where users can divide the screen into customizable partitions. Each partition retains or generates a new random color and can be further split vertically or horizontally using buttons. Key features include:

- Dynamic Partitioning: Split any partition vertically or horizontally.
- Resizable Partitions: Adjust partition sizes with click-and-drag functionality.
- Random Colors: Each new partition generates a unique color.
- Partition Removal: Remove any partition with the "-" button.

- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
